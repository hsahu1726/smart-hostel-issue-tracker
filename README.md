# Problem Statement

**Digital Hostel Issue Management System**

In most hostels, infrastructure and maintenance issues are reported through informal channels such as verbal complaints, WhatsApp groups, or manual registers. These methods lack tracking, accountability, transparency, and often lead to delayed or ignored resolutions.

The goal of this project is to design and implement a **centralized, transparent, and role‑based digital platform** that allows students to report hostel issues and enables hostel management to track, manage, and resolve them efficiently.

## Project Overview

**Smart Hostel Issue Tracker** is a role‑based web platform designed to digitize hostel issue reporting and resolution.

The system replaces unstructured complaint methods with a structured workflow where:
- Students can submit and track issues
- Hostel management can view, update, and resolve complaints
- Status updates are visible in real time

The platform ensures **transparency, accountability, and faster resolution** of hostel‑related problems.
