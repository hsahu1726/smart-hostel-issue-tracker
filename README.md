# 📌 Problem Statement

**Digital Hostel Issue Management System**

In most hostels, infrastructure and maintenance issues are reported through informal channels such as verbal complaints, WhatsApp groups, or manual registers. These methods lack tracking, accountability, transparency, and often lead to delayed or ignored resolutions.

The goal of this project is to design and implement a **centralized, transparent, and role‑based digital platform** that allows students to report hostel issues and enables hostel management to track, manage, and resolve them efficiently.
